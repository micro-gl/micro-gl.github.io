> **Language** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- **`C++11`**, does not use any **`STL`** library and **standard library**.
- **headers only** library
- most functions are templates, which means you compile only what is used
- compile-time polymorphism (no runtime virtual methods)
- support for 32 bits and 64 bits
- self contained and modular.

> **Graphics** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- very modular design. if something does not exist, you can implement your own
- over 10 blending modes impemented, you can wrote your own and supply as well
- **`porter-duff`** alpha compositing
- support for 2d sampler
- can support any pixel coding you need, we implemeted a lot out of the box
- can render 3d geometries
- we support 3d shaders
- no need for **GPU**, it is all **CPU**
- no need for **FPU**
- support for any number system including **`Q`** numbers (fixed point), no need to use float points

> **Geometry** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- fast implementation for common shapes (rect, rounded rectangles, circles, triangles)
- batch traingles like **GPU** would
- support polygons of any type convex, simple, and complex polygons 
- path fills(with even-odd or zero-one fill rule)
- stroke fills
- quadrilaterals
- bezier patches
- we providea dynamic array, but you can plug your own.
