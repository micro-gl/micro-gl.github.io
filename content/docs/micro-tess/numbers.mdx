# Introduction

most of `micro-tess` algorithms can use any of the following numbers types at compile-time:
- `Q` numbers
- `float` numbers
- `double` numbers
- any custom user defined number types

> most of the methods in `micro-tess` are templates that use a generic `number` template argument
to abstract away the number type.

## Q numbers
Q numbers are fixed point integers, that have configurable number of bits  
for the precision of the number.

```cpp
#include <micro-tess/Q.h>
// q_15 have 15 bits of precision
using q_15 = Q<15, int32_t>;

q_15 q1{5}, q2{2};
q_15 q3 = q1/q2;
```

you can convert q numbers into other precision with
```cpp
Q<4> q4 = q3;
```

you can also cast them to other numbers
```cpp
float f1 = float(q4);
double d1 = float(q4);
int f1 = int(q4);
```

you can also construct them from other types
```cpp

Q<15> q1{0.00281f};
Q<15> q2 = 3.14f
```

you can also apply math function on them
```cpp

#include <micro-tess/Q.h>
#include <micro-tess/math.h>
// q_15 have 15 bits of precision
using q_15 = Q<15>;

Q<15> q1{9.32f};

auto q_sqrt = microtess::math::sqrt(q1);
auto q_abs = microtess::math::abs(q1);
```

## Custom number types
**`Q`** is an example of a custom number type. You can create your own if you like,
just make sure your type has all the opertor overloads suitable for a number:
- Can be constructed from other number types (copy constructor for your type) and conversion constructor
(from `int`, `float` and `double`).
- Implements **assignment** operator `your_number_type::operator=(const your_number_type &)`
- Implements **math** operator `+, +=, -, -=, /, /=, *, *=`
- Implements **negate** operator `your_number_type::operator -()`
- Implements **comparison** operators `==, !=, <, <=, >, >=`
- Implements **casting** operators for most integral types
