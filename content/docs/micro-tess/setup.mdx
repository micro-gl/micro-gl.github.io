# Introduction
**Fast**, **Slim**, **Embeddable**, **Allocator-aware**, **Headers files** only **`C++11`** geometry tesselation  
library for vector graphics, that can run on any 32/64 bits computer with or without **FPU**.  
**No standard library required**.

Check out the git repo at [https://github.com/micro-gl/micro-tess](https://github.com/micro-gl/micro-tess)

## Installing `micro{tess}`
`micro-tess` is a headers only library, which gives the following install possibilities:
1. Using `cmake` to invoke the `install` target, that will copy everything in your system via
```
$ mkdir cmake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --install .
```
2. Copying the `include/micro-tess` to anywhere you want.

## Consuming `micro{tess}`
Following options are available:
1. copy the project to a sub folder of your project. inside your **`CMakeLists.txt`** add
```
add_subdirectory(/path/to/micro-tess)
target_link_libraries(your_app micro-tess)
```
2. If you installed **`micro{tess}`** with option 1 (see above) at your system, you can instead
```
find_package(micro-tess CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_app micro-tess::micro-tess)
```
3. If you have not installed, you can add in your app's `CMakeLists.txt`
```
target_include_directories(app path/to/micro-tess/folder/include/)
```
4. If you manually copied the `include/micro-tess` to the default system include path,  
   you can use `cmake/Findmicro-tess.cmake` to automatically create the cmake targets
```
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/Findmicro-tess/folder)
find_package(micro-tess REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_app micro-tess::micro-tess)
```
5. Just copy the `include/micro-tess` into a sub folder of your project and include the header  
   files you need with relative path in your source files.

## Running Examples
First make sure you have
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) installed at your system.
- [microgl](https://github.com/micro-gl/micro-gl) installed at your system.
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) installed at your system.

There are two ways:
1. Use your favourite IDE to load the root `CMakeLists.txt` file, and then it   
   will pick up all of the targets, including the examples
2. Using the command line:
```
$ mkdir cmake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target <example_name>
$ ../examples/bin/example_name
```
