There are various ways, that `microgl` can be consumed and used

## 1. using *CMake*
download the project to a sub folder of your project. inside your `CMakeLists.txt` add  
```cmake
  add_subdirectory(/path/to/microgl)
  target_link_libraries(app microgl)
```
if you installed `micro{gl}` (see below) at your system, you can instead
```cmake
  target_link_libraries(app path/to/microgl/static/file)
  target_include_directories(app path/to/microgl/include/)
```

## 2. embed *micro{gl}* source code in your own build
download the project to a local folder inside your project, preferably `${YOUR_APP}/libs/microgl`.  
then, make sure to:  
- add files in `microgl/src` to your compilation step
- add `microgl/include/public/` to your include paths

## 3. use *CMake* to create a static lib
```bash
$ cd path/to/microgl
$ mkdir cake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target microgl
$ ../bin/libmicrogl.a # in unix like systems
```

## 4. use *CMake* to create a shared lib
```bash
$ cd path/to/microgl
$ mkdir cake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target microgl-shared
$ ../bin/libmicrogl-shared.dylib # in unix like systems
```

## 5. install *microGL* with *CMake*
this will install static and dynamic libs into the system (`/usr/local/` for unix like).
header files will be copied as well (`/usr/local/include`)
```bash
$ cd path/to/microgl
$ mkdir cmake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target install
```
