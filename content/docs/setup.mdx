# Introduction
There are various ways, that **`microgl`** can be consumed and used

Because `microgl` is a headers only library, installing just means copying the `include/public/microgl`
folder to your system search path or another folder and then set the include path in your build.
the `cmake` file also has an install target.

## Using *CMake*
download the project to a sub folder of your project. inside your **`CMakeLists.txt`** add
```cmake
add_subdirectory(/path/to/microgl)
target_link_libraries(your_app microgl)
```
if you installed **`micro{gl}`** (see above) at your system, you can instead
```cmake
target_include_directories(app path/to/microgl/install/include/)
```

## Install *microGL* with *CMake*
this will install static and dynamic libs into the system (**`/usr/local/`** for unix like).
header files will be copied as well (**`/usr/local/include`**)
```bash
$ cd path/to/microgl
$ mkdir cmake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target install
```
