There are various ways, that **`microgl`** can be consumed and used

## 1. using *CMake*
download the project to a sub folder of your project. inside your **`CMakeLists.txt`** add  
```cmake
  add_subdirectory(/path/to/microgl)
  target_link_libraries(your_app microgl)
```
if you installed **`micro{gl}`** (see below) at your system, you can instead
```cmake
  target_include_directories(app path/to/microgl/install/include/)
```

## 2. embed *micro{gl}* source code in your own build
download the project to a local folder inside your project, preferably **`${YOUR_APP}/libs/microgl`**.  
then, make sure to:  
- add **`microgl/include/public/`** to your include paths

## 4. install *microGL* with *CMake*
this will install static and dynamic libs into the system (**`/usr/local/`** for unix like).
header files will be copied as well (**`/usr/local/include`**)
```bash
$ cd path/to/microgl
$ mkdir cmake-build-release
$ cd cmake-build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . --target install
```
